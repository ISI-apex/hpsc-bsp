# Instructions for run-qemu for pre-loading data into memory

# For booting HPPS without reliance on non-volatile NAND memory, by pre-loading
# and storing the Linux root file system in DRAM (not reasonable on real HW).

# CPU IDs: TRC:H 0, RTPS R52: 1-2, RTPS A53: 3, HPPS: 4-12
# ADDR='-' means do not pass an address (e.g. for ELF loading)

# ID              (CPU:)ADDR            FILE
