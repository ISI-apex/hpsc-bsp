# Instructions for run-qemu for pre-loading data into memory

# For fast boot mode in which Qemu loads the images directly into
# DRAM upon startup of the machine (not possible on real HW).

# NOTE: addresses and file paths are given via variables, instead of
# directly here, because the hpsc-bsp/run-qemu.sh script needs to
# build a memory image that needs the addresses and file paths.

# CPU IDs: TRC:H 0, RTPS R52: 1-2, RTPS A53: 3, HPPS: 4-12
# ADDR='-' means do not pass an address (e.g. for ELF loading)
